# Dodger

Dodger is a split-screen, local multiplayer racing game, developed as part of an internship assignment for Vyorius. In this action-packed game, two cars race against each other on the same track. The goal is simple: reach the finish line first. But there's a catchâ€”players start with 5 lives, and every time the cars collide, they lose a life!
